"""Burkina Faso"" was among the top ten trending topics in Kenya on Thursday morning, after an article headlined: 'Burkina Faso Parliament set ablaze' was retrieved from the archives and began circulating again online.

Looking at the tweets as well as Facebook posts, it's clear that some online users thought the fire had just happened. In fact, the parliament in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou was actually torched back in 2014. So why did it start trending again, on the other side of Africa, in July 2019?",false,false,0.4980941
